One of the challenges of managing an extensive garden or microfarm is the identification of plants. If you're a fan of biodiversity, you might have dozens of different plants and if you are an addled old man, like me, you'll forget the names of things. A great way to keep it all sorted out is to label everything, and nothing makes a more attractive label than milled aluminum! Or whatever.

Here is a nifty little app for generating Carbide Create .c2d files with panelized plant labels. Just feed in a JSON containing plants' common and scientific names, and out pops one or more .c2d files. Finally, load these up in Carbide Create, make any final adjustments and generate your tool path! You will marvel at the gorgeous consisten results.

Default configuration assumes a Nomad 883, but there is some degree of configurability in the appsettings. Marvelous!
